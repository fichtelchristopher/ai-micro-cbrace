The Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-Based Ensembles (HIVECOTE) algorithm is an extension of COTE with significant modifications (Lines
et al, 2018), including a new type of spectral classifier called Random Interval Spectral Ensemble, two more classifiers (BOSS and Time Series Forest), and a hierarchical voting procedure, defined as a weighted average of the probabilities returned
by each classifier, with the weights being proportional to the classification accuracy
estimated through cross-validation.
